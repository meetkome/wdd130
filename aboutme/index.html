    <h2>Kome</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Oghenekome Igho, but I prefer y'all call me Kome. I am from the south-south part of Nigeria. I am
        recently enrolled in BYU idaho to obtain a Bachelors Degree in Science of Professional Study and am looking at
        pursuing a career as a web developer and everything i can become.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter days Saints for one year and two months. The
        things I love most about the Church is how it is centered on Jesus Christ, the HolySpirit and Heavenly Father
    </p>
    <p>I currently work as a project supervisor in an a building and construction firm, but i'd like to transition into
        the IT world where i can be less physically involved. Taking the course here is a chance for me to learn and
        become a web programmer and i am really excited. As we progress through this course i hope to have a swell time
        getting to know everyone on here. Thank you for taking your time to look through my web page. </p>
